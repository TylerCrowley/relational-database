This database is designed to resemble a magic item shop, like you would find in a role playing game such as Dungeons & Dragons.
Because of this, the products are instead called "Items", the sellers are "shops", and the customers are "adventurers".
The items themselves are taken directly from the list provided by https://mythical.ink/en/rpg-tools/dnd-item-list, all the shops, names, and addresses were generated by ChatGPT to save time.

The setup.sql file is designed to do 100% of the work needed to initialize the databse, once MySQL is installed. It creates the database, all the tables, the necessary user, all stored procedures I use, and the thousands of example entries.
I have indexes on both Items and OrderItems, as they are by far the largest and slowest tables. I indexed both by the most common attribute used when searching for them, an Items name and the Order id of the items ordered.

I chose Python as the backend, since it is what I am most familiar with and excels with this kind of data processing. Streamlit was what I found to be the most straight forward front end, as it made visually appealing sites which integrated seemslessly into my code. Meaning that my project is only one file and under 400 lines.
